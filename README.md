------------Steps Followed for "Toman Bike Share" Dashboard Development Using SQL and Power BI----------------

Data Cleaning and Linking Using SQL:

Data Import and Structuring: Imported the raw dataset into SQL to ensure data integrity.

Data Cleaning: Cleaned the dataset by removing null values, duplicates, and any inconsistent 
entries (e.g., incorrect timestamps).

Data Linking: Joined relevant tables using SQL queries to create a unified dataset, linking
customer demographics, rides, and financial data.

Output to Power BI: Exported the cleaned and structured data from SQL into a format suitable
for Power BI.

2. Dashboard Development in Power BI:

Data Import: Imported the cleaned SQL data file into Power BI to begin creating the dashboard.

3. Data Visualization and Analysis:

Hourly Revenue Analysis: Visualized hourly revenue patterns using Chart to understand 
peak times for bike rentals.

Profit and Revenue Trends: Created Chart to track long-term profit and revenue trends
over time, highlighting key periods of growth or decline.

Rider Demographics:
Segmented customers by age, gender, and location and analyze which customer groups 
contributed the most to revenue.


-----------------------------------------Recommendation-----------------------------------------------

Conservative Increase: Considering the substantial increase last year, a more conservative increase might
be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range of 10-15% 
could test the market's response without risking a significant loss of customers.


Price Setting:

If the price in 2022 was $4.99, a 10% increase would make the new price about $5.49.

A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.


Recommended Strategy:

Market Analysis: Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes,
and the overall economic environment. This can guide whether leaning towards the lower or higher end of the suggested 
increase.

Segmented Pricing Strategy:

Consider different pricing for casual versus registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities.
Monitor and Adjust: Implement the new prices but be ready to adjust based on immediate customer feedback and sales data.
Monitoring closely will allow you to fine-tune your pricing strategy without committing fully to a price that might turn 
out to be too high.
